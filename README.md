If you want to use this bot, you are gonna need to set your environment by creating a `.env` file a the root directory. Once you have done it, fill him with your credentials like so :
```.env
TOKEN=EFZOefij04ZEF234?ZEifjozeif2jzef.fzeuhfozf
```

## Guidelines
The `master` branch is the production. A hook has been set to auto-deploy on a `master` push. All development feature branch should be called `feature/something_cool_to_build`.
